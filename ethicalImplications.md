In developing an email client, it is our responsibility to ensure that 
user information, data, and emails are not shared with any third-parties 
or internally within the team. Spam will be prevented and a clear set of 
user conditions will be provided on our home page.


The app we are developing can be used by people around the world to 
communicate with each other. The app can be used as for a number of 
purposes two of which would be professional and personal communication. 
People who use that app can communicate with eachother over long distances 
and generally, the app would help make people across the world more 
connected.


From an economic point of view, this application would support the growth 
of a countryâ€™s economy. This would support businesses and also the quality 
of life of citizens by providing a digital way of sending and receiving 
information.


An email web app, even on a small scale, can have a positive environmental 
impact. By enabling paperless communication, email can reduce the need for 
printed materials, which in turn can reduce the demand for paper and ink. 
Additionally, the use of email can help reduce transportation emissions by 
reducing the need for physical mail delivery. Finally, email can help 
reduce the energy consumption associated with physical mail processing, 
such as sorting and transportation.
